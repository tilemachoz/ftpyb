# FTP Backup with Python

FTP Backup with Python does two things:
  1. Provides a cli ui for FTP back up. Few simple commands (cd, ls, pwd, getf, getd etc) for navigation and backing up an ftp directory.
  2. The automation mode. This makes possible through a (ridiculous) simple cli ui to create python scripts for backing up particular         directories on an ftp server.

Docs will follow soon.
